Create a NextJs app using command
`npx create-next-app@latest`
Integrating NextJs with redux is becoming a [*0*].
Use these docs : https://redux-toolkit.js.org/usage/nextjs

Completed the NextJS + Redux integration
Made a Navbar component for Home Page
To make home page got inspired from this site : https://www.awwwards.com/websites/ui-design/
I got the Navbar component from : https://www.freefrontend.com/
And i modified it

Finished a basic setup for home page of Ephemera
Atleast it doesnt look ugly on the first look
As always i cant make the components so took it from : https://www.freefrontend.com/

There should have been a yesterday's log but i ran some random git command and everything vanished to poof
I integrated typescript and nodejs
I integrated Nextjs and socket.io to form a basic chat app
Again chat component was a gift from the developers

### 07/07/2024 01:10

I added chat room feature to the app.
Also hosted both frontend and backend.
Spent a lot of time on setting up .env for Nextjs cause it was giving undefined. Solved it somehow

### 09/07/2024 00:45

I hosted the backend and frontend.
Yesterday when i hosted i didn't add dist file to the repository. So ofcourse the backend didn't run.
I corrected it but still some crappy bug has crept up.
I'll see tomorrow

### 10/07/2024 00:53

I hosting still aint working. So i focused on ENd to end communication and 1v1 chatting.
For E2E i will do it some other but i got the idea ready.
For 1v1 i have done half of it but i just cant concentrate.
Hope everything works well

### 11/07/2024 21:08

Yesterday I completed 1v1 chat. Didn't get time to log yesterday.

### 12/07/2024 00:49

I have half completed the E2E encryption. I'm having problem in storing publicKey in Redis cache.
Have to do E2E for group also.
Referenced from : https://getstream.io/blog/web-crypto-api-chat/

### 13/07/2024 23:36

The E2E just didn't work. Like i have no idea. why ?
I have tried every website and every prompt for chatGPT but i didn't work.
I spent more than 12 hours. I dont know i will i try again. I will try if i can.

### 14/07/2024 00:58

I think i know why the E2E didn't work, because i just watched a 1 min video of E2E.
And tried to copy everything. So dont do these just learn the basics.
I know i may lame but i am tired of e2e so i am gonna do Webrtc.
But learn webrtc properly. Source : https://github.com/hnasr/javascript_playground/tree/master/webrtc

After a very long skip. Had exams and had to make a webiste for an event.
I looked into P2P a bit more. I was planning to do webRTC without any external library.
But I think i am not that advanced to do it without any library.
So did it with PeerJs. It is a easy to use library for P2P technology.
I will be only doing messaging through P2P now. Will work on video call feature later on.
