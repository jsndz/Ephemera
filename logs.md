Create a NextJs app using command
`npx create-next-app@latest`
Integrating NextJs with redux is becoming a [*0*].

Completed the NextJS + Redux integration
Made a Navbar component for Home Page
To make home page got inspired from this site : https://www.awwwards.com/websites/ui-design/
I got the Navbar component from : https://www.freefrontend.com/
And i modified it

There should have been a yesterday's log but i ran some random git command and everything vanished to poof
I integrated typescript and nodejs
I integrated Nextjs and socket.io to form a basic chat app
Again chat component was a gift from the developers

I added chat room feature to the app.
Also hosted both frontend and backend.
Spent a lot of time on setting up .env for Nextjs cause it was giving undefined. Solved it somehow

### 09/07/2024 00:45

I hosted the backend and frontend.
Yesterday when i hosted i didn't add dist file to the repository. So ofcourse the backend didn't run.
I corrected it but still some crappy bug has crept up.
I'll see tomorrow

I hosting still aint working. So i focused on ENd to end communication and 1v1 chatting.
For E2E i will do it some other but i got the idea ready.
For 1v1 i have done half of it but i just cant concentrate.
Hope everything works well

### 11/07/2024 21:08

Yesterday I completed 1v1 chat. Didn't get time to log yesterday.

I have half completed the E2E encryption. I'm having problem in storing publicKey in Redis cache.
Have to do E2E for group also.
